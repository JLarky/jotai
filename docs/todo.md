- [ ] fix README.md

- [ ] introduction/core.md needs to read more like an introduction into concepts and less like API reference
- [ ] api/core.md needs to read more like API reference and less like an introduction to concepts

- [ ] api/utils.md I only done with `atomWithReset/useResetAtom/RESET` there, other apis need to be described in similar style

- [x] guides/debugging.md needs to read more like guide on debugging and less like API reference

- [ ] api/devtools.md probably OK?
- [ ] introduction/async.md looks OK to me
- [ ] introduction/comparison.md looks OK to me
- [ ] introduction/showcase.md looks OK to me
- [ ] guides/typescript.md looks OK to me
- [ ] guides/nextjs.md looks OK to me
- [ ] guides/persistence.md looks OK to me
- [ ] guides/resettable.md this and persistence is how I think guides should look
- [ ] api/optics.md probably OK for now, but add function types
- [ ] api/immer.md probably OK for now, but add function types
